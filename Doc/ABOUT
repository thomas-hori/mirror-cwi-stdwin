1. Target systems

STDWIN is aimed at C programs.  It consists of a few header files (of
which only one is visible to the user) and a library.  In most cases
some system-provided libraries must also be used in the linking phase.

Currently, full STDWIN is available for the following environments:

(Note that in all cases the code is in beta test state; there may be
bugs, functionality may change slightly in the future and new
functionality may be added, but the basic framework isn't going to
change much.)

*       X version 11, release 4 (should still work with release 2 and 3)
*       Apple Macintosh, using either THINK C (4.02) or MPW C (2.02)

You may volunteer to create a version for your favourite system, or to
port it to your favourite C compiler for the mentioned micro.

A subset, emulating most of STDWIN's functionality on an alphanumeric
display (excluding line drawing, but including multiple (non-overlapping)
windows, menus, text editing etc.) is available for:

*       Any decent Unix that has termcap (tested with 4.{2,3} BSD)
*       MS-DOS, using the Microsoft C compiler (4.0)

Sorry, there are no versions yet for SunTools, SunView, NeWS, X10,
MS-Windows, Presentation Manager, Atari ST or the Amiga.
The code is remarkably portable to different processor types and
various Unix flavors, as long as they are derived from 4.xBSD.


2. Getting the full scoop

I have written a paper about STDWIN which has been published as a
CWI report (Guido van Rossum: STDWIN -- A Standard Window System
Interface.  Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science, report
CS-R8817.  Amsterdam, 1988).

STDWIN was posted to alt.sources around february 1991.
It should be available from sites that archive this newsgroup, but I
have no information on that.  I also post patches to this group.  (I
will post the entire source to comp.sources.misc when I think the
product is a little bit more finished.)

STDWIN is available from a number of ftp sites.
The * in file names is the version number, e.g., 0.9.5 (the last digit
is the patch level).

Current version number is 0.9.6 .

prepared to receive up to half a megabyte (in 32K pieces in "shar"
format).  If you're interested, write to guido@cwi.nl.


3. Basic functionality

STDWIN allows multiple "full-function" windows, roughly in Macintosh
style (title bar, grow box, close box, scroll bars).  The appearance of
windows is determined by the default of the underlying window manager,
and so are other limitations (e.g., overlapping, maximum size, etc.).
Windows are dynamically created and destroyed by the application, never
directly by the user or the window manager.

STDWIN uses a coordinate system derived from the display's coordinate
system: (0, 0) is top left, with X pointing right and Y pointing down
(these are actually called h and v).  Pixel size is that of the display.
There are enquiry functions to ask for the display size in pixels and in
millimeters.

The application is responsible for redrawing the window contents when it
is exposed.  This is done by associating a "draw procedure" with each
window, which knows how to draw the entire window's contents.  It gets
passed a pointer to the window and the coordinates of the rectangle that
needs to be redrawn, so it can (although it needn't) restrict itself to
that area.  STDWIN guarantees that a window's redraw procedure is only
called while the application is waiting for an input event (most
implementations simply turn exposure events into calls to the draw
procedure).

If the application wants to change part of the graphics it is
displaying, this is usually done in a two-phase process: first, STDWIN
is told that a particular area of the screen must be changed; later,
when the application starts waiting for input events again, the draw
procedure is called to update the indicated area (and any other area
that was exposed or damaged in some way).

The application defines the width and height of the area it wants to
draw; this needn't bear any relation to the window or screen size.  This
area is called the "document" although you may also think of it as a
virtual window.  The actual window generally displays a sub-area of the
document; the window's scroll bars indicate the position of the window
with respect to the document.  The application always uses the
coordinates of its document; STDWIN performs the translation to window
or screen coordinates are required by the window manager, and ensures
clipping of all output to the window.

STDWIN is event-based.  An application is expected to have a main loop
containing a "get event" call followed by a switch on the event type.
There is no event mask; an application can simply ignore events it isn't
interested in.  The most important event types are:

ACTIVATE:       A window becomes active (keyboard attached and/or topmost)

CHAR:           ASCII character key pressed (except BS, TAB, CR)

COMMAND:        special key or function (CLOSE, TAB, RETURN, BS, CANCEL,
                arrow keys etc.)

MOUSE:          MOUSE DOWN, MOUSE MOVE (only while down), MOUSE UP;
                fields in the event record indicate the h, v position,
                the number of the button, and the "click number" if the
                event is potentially part of a multiple-click sequence

MENU:           menu id and item number of a menu selection

SIZE:           user has resized the window

TIMER:          the window's timer went off; each window has one
                programmable timer which can be set to go off at N/10
                seconds in the future.  When the timer goes off a TIMER
                event is returned.

Normally, STDWIN draws text in a single font.  The actual font used
depends on the underlying window manager (and can sometimes be
influenced by the application programmer and/or the end user in a
system-dependent manner).  The font may be proportionally spaced, and
there are enquiry functions to find out the dimensions of characters and
strings.  There are also functions to change the font name and point
size dynamically; but these work different in different systems,
especially the allowed font names differ drastically.  This feature is
used with some success in the ditroff previewer that is supplied as a
demo.

There are functions to draw text and simple lines, rectangles and
circles, and ways to erase, shade or invert rectangular areas.  There is
no way (yet) to do general bitblt operations, or to influence the pen
shape.


4. Higher level functionality

STDWIN provides a blinking vertical bar which can be used to indicate
the text insertion point, so the application needn't use TIMER events to
do the blinking.

STDWIN provides Macintosh-style menus.  Each window has its own set of
menus, although by default all menus apply to all windows.  A reasonably
number of menus per window is allowed, each with a reasonable number of
(textual) menu items.  Menus can be changed dynamically.  Items can be
enabled or disabled, and a 'tick mark' can be placed in front of an
item.  Each menu item may have a shortcut character, which, when typed
in combination with some system-defined meta key (e.g., ALT or an ESC-
prefix) selects the menu item (if enabled).  Menu selection is done
completely "underwater"; all the application notices are MENU events.

STDWIN has a few simple routines to display Mac-style "dialog boxes",
e.g., to show an error message, or to ask a yes/no question or to ask
for a string to be typed.  There is also a predefined function to ask
for a file name, which may allow the user to browse the file system in
some implementations.

STDWIN comes with a package built on top of the basic functionality, to
edit arbitrary blocks of text (cf. Macintosh TEXTEDIT).  In the future,
more packages will be provided, e.g., a package to provide a simple file
editor (available now!), a package to display a scrolling list of items,
a package to define a list of arbitrary labeled "buttons", and a package
to simplify the binding of menus to functions somewhat, and a VT100
emulator (available now!).
